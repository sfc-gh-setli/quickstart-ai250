   "source": "# 1. Overview\nEarnings calls play a pivotal role in shaping investor perceptions. The quality of communication between executives and analysts can significantly influence company performance. On-topic and proactive exeutives, who deliver proactive presentations, anticipate market queries, and provide clear, on-topic answers to analysts’ questions—consistently outperform their peers. Conversely, off-topic and reactive executives, who fail to address analysts’ key inquiries during presentations, and provide off-topic responses—significantly underperform.\n\nExecutives' ability to anticipate investor concerns and maintain a focused dialogue fosters confidence and strategic communication. In contrast, failing to provide clarity when analysts seek additional information can lead to misalignment and breakdowns in transparency. A long (short) portfolio of on-topic and proactive (off-topic and reactive) generates +515bps of annualized alpha.\n\nThis notebook serves as a introduction for the research detailed in Quantitative Research & Solutions’ recent publication, [\"Questioninig the Answers: LLM's enter the Boardroom.\"](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/questioning-the-answers-llms-enter-the-boardroom) IIt analyse executive on-topicness and proactiveness using the analysts questions, executives answers and LLM answers. This research harness alpha using LLM tools, including vector embeddings, vector cosine similarity, and the LLM quesiton answering. There is a longer version avalible upon request that also covers how to create the input data from the datasets described in section 2, please reach out to QRS@spglobal.com for access to the longer version."

Working with the Data: Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG)\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a tool that improves LLM consistency by retrieving relevant information before answering a question.\n\nFor this task the LLM needs to be as consistent as possible in its responses to the analysts’ questions as inconsistency will lead to variations in cosine similarity scores and disrupt feature generation downstream.\n\nTo combat this, we designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine that chunks the prepared remarks sentence-by-sentence and retrieves the optimal retrieval percentage of sentences most similar to the question. Inconsistency occurs when the LLM is provided with too little (or too much) context, it becomes uninformed (unspecific). The optimal retrieval percentage for consistency is 60%.\n\nIn the cells below, we vector embed all questions, prepared remark sentences and answer sentences using the snowflake-arctic-m embedding model. Then use the cosine similarity from the (question vs prepared remark sentences) and (question vs answer sentences) to select top 60% most relevant prepared remark and answer sentences to the question from S&P Global Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\n\n## 5.1 S&P Global Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nSelect and seperate the prepared remarks, questions and answers sections of the S&P Global Q4 2024 Earnings Call"

Example: \"You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about technology in a concise manner.\"\n\nUser: Represents the input or queries made by the person interacting with the model. These are the prompts or requests that the model responds to. Example: \"What is the purpose of the OpenAI API?\"\n\nAssistant: Reflects the model's response to the user's query, shaped by the system's instructions and the user's input. Example: \"The OpenAI API is designed to enable developers to integrate language models into their applications for tasks like answering questions, generating content, and more.\"\n\nIn our research, executive prepared remarks are labelled as assistant messages, analyst's questions as User messages and executive answers as Assistant messages\n\n### 6.1.1 Construct COMPLETE Assistant Message with QA Pair Snippet"

Proactive executives who anticipate market concerns and provide concise, on-topic responses foster transparency, aligning with investor expectations and driving superior returns. The findings demonstrate that firms with Efficient Communicators achieve statistically significant outperformance, while Total Redirectors suffer from diminished confidence and underperformance. These insights validate the critical role of strategic communication in shaping investor perceptions and influencing market outcomes.\n\nAdvanced analytical tools, such as vector embeddings and cosine similarity metrics, enable nuanced evaluations of executive-analyst interactions, revealing measurable performance effects across different communication styles. While large language models (LLMs) enhance feature extraction, challenges like forward-looking bias and inconsistency highlight the need for caution in time-sensitive tasks. Overall, the integration of proactive, clear, and relevant communication strategies remains paramount in fostering investor trust and maximizing financial success in a competitive marketplace."
